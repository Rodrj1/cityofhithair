## Map

The map features some NPCs that have some information concerning the situation and a merchant with some items. At the bottom left corner there is a dungeon icon in display that takes
you to the cemetery. You can start there. Each level will feature a different display in that section. The map also has background music that can be disabled by clicking on the volume
icon at the top right corner.

Now in the cemetery the bottom left corner shows different options. You can go back to the city or advance to the next dungeon (the mausoleum) which you can only do
if you kill all enemies present in the level.

## Battle

Combat is turn-based. All abilities consume the turn, but potions do not. In order to use a spell against an opponent you must click on the spell icon and then click
on the enemy. Self-cast spells will fire inmediately upon click.
