# CITY OF HITHAIR

Play: https://cityofhithair.netlify.app/

Simple turn-based minigame. For the sake of testing, defeat of the player has been removed; instead, the game will follow as if the player had won any confrontation that he loses.

## Hero Selection

Choose between two heroes, a knight and a dark wizard. Once you select someone, you can give whatever name you like.

The merchant sells tomes of knowledge that increases either Dark Magic or Combat. There is also one extra spell available for the dark wizard.

On the right side of the screen there are two boxes of information. One contains the player's hero information, his stats and current items. Below it options to move on to the next level (which you can only do if the current level is cleared).
