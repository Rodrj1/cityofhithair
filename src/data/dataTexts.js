  hithair:
    "Once it was a city of glory. But Kimvaema, our neighbors, had left us after murdering our hero and defender, Tamoé. His murder was never accounted for, and Kimvaema never offered its hand in due ransom. No, they left us here alone, facing the servants of an ancient evil that is long gone.",
  evil: "This evil called himself Thune. Kimvaema's greatest bluff was that he was Maerum, Lord of the Valryn. Excuses for their defeat. Thune was powerful to such an extent that his evil still lingers in the great dungeons beneath. The extension of what he built is unknown, his creations are all around the world. From frozen and forgotten Atro, to Mandarlena and beyond the Neptun's Sea. But he was no Maerum. Thune made unfathomable dungeons, Maerum spoke the moon into existence.",
  tamoe:
    "A honorable warrior of old. He challenged Thune and his servants and kept them at bay. But then, Kimvaema sent a champion claiming that Tamoé was seen making dealings with the evil spirit Koetria, daughter of Thune. They even said Tamoé was in love with the spirit. Thune and his offspring wroke havok in Kimvaema during that time. When Tamoé proved stronger against the evil, they murdered him and spreaded those lies.\n\nSince his death, Hithair has not yet recovered, for the spirits beneath took our city captive when Tamoé was no more to defend us. Much of that evil left when Thune escaped beyond the sea, but some stayed.",
  dungeons:
    "They were carved in ancient times below the mausoleum in the cemetery. And they go so deep in the earth it pains me to think of it. Whatever evil lurked in those ages only Tamoé could know. Not so long ago, a wanderer came here seeking to enter.",
  wanderer:
    "This man called himself Nicolai. Since his coming the dead had risen from the grave. I think he believed he could control that evil and grant himself free passage. He will be delayed, if not killed. The corpses might be tamed with magic, but the dark knights served only Thune.",
  darkknights:
    "They are in books, and in tales. Some served Hithair under the tutelage of Tamoé, others came from Kimvaema.\n\nWhen Tamoé was murdered, they thought it was Thune, so they went in wrath to pursue him in the dungeons. None came alive.\n\nThe knights of Kimvaema pursued Thune below their city seeking for a woman called Thinmel, who had been imprisoned by him. Most fell. All dungeons are interwoven, so some of Kimvaema's drifted here.\n\nNow they wander as shadows of the past, serving their murderer for all eternity.",
  thinmel:
    "The tale of Thinmel is of Wrath itself. Born in Kimvaema she was a mighty warrior. But she got captured by Thune and his daughter, Koetria. The texts do not say why, but for whatever reason Thune kept her alive, buried in his dungeons. There she would suffer a torture beyond imagination for years.\n\nLater, her sister Ckenurith and a warrior called Ingil reunited a host to storm the earth beneath, finally releasing Thinmel from her chains and torture.\n\nThinmel laid in bed for a full year before her eyes dared to see the light once more. When they did, a raging fire kindled beneath her body, her hair turned ashen, and her footfall scorched the ground in her wake. But she was not herself, only rage drived her forward. She learnt that Thune had fled beyond the northern sea to Mandarlena and she followed.\n\nThe port was closed. Ingil's father, Ringil, would not allow her to pass, so she beheaded him and sailed to the seas alone. No tale holds an end to what happened between Thune and Thinmel, nor speak of any confrontation. One thing is sure, Thune banished in history before Thinmel did, and some texts incline me to believe he feared her greatly, for the Aspect of Wrath had taken a hold of her, meaning she could not be killed. Not even an army could have taken Thinmel and hope to win.\n\nThough she pursued an ancient evil, her death was motive of celebration, for she would lay all to ruin if it availed her to get close to Thune. No, there could be no negotation, or talk, or anything save destruction. Of all the aspects of the universe, Wrath is the most deadly. Thinmel was a honorable warrior, but she lost her humanity forever.",

    "In a past age regiments of knights were sent to face the evil that scourged the land. Both Hithair and Kimvaema were drawn to it. One leader, whose name is forgotten to history, was captured, and in that captivity he betrayed his company. His friends then were turned to him, and by dark sorcery Thune forced him to eat them.\n\nThough the rest of the story is lost, in different ages there is a mention of a knight that craves the flesh of the living. I pressume this figure is the traitor captain who was brought back to life by whatever roams the underground.",

Who would have thought they chose this dungeons as their shelter.\n\nTwo of them became hostile, I guess now Nir is father of five sons. A third one called himself Hawnyr and was too afraid to attack after seeing his brothers die.",

My brothers, in their rageful nature, challenged him but were freezed in place and slaughtered. He spared me, but demanded some 'hidden information,' yet I heard anything about that. There is no Lord in this place that would hide anything. He did not believe me, so he sent me to guard the gallery. I wanted to deny but felt as if death itself came with his command. I don't know what he is, but in my two hundred and fifty-six years living among Thune's spawns I have never seen anything close to him. He is no human.",
